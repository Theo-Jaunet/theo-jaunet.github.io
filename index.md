## Who am I ?

I am a Ph.D. student at INSA Lyon - LIRIS laboratory whithin the teams [SICAL](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/sical) and [Imagine](https://liris.cnrs.fr/equipe/imagine), where my advisors are [Romain Vuillemot](http://romain.vuillemot.net/), and [Christian Wolf](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/christian.wolf/). 


My research interest is broadly how visualization can help, interpreting, understanding, and improving deep learning models.


## Thesis 01/09/2018

My research is funded by a French ministry PhD fellowship since 01/09/2018, lasting 3 years. My thesis is also supported by the [M2I Project] (https://projet.liris.cnrs.fr/mi2/)


### Transparency and Explainability for Machine Learning


With the help of recent contributions, machine learning methods have been successfully applied in various fields. However, despite great results, these methods lack of transparency and thus cannot be widely deployed. Explainable AI is needed from machine learning experts to help them understand when their models need more training, have biases, need more or less complexity, and therefore produce more stable and rational models in less time.
  On the other hand, non-machine learning experts, also need to know when the model may or may not be reliable in order to build new legislations around AI, and therefore help its democratization.<br/>
During this thesis, my contributions will mainly be focused on how data visualization may help to better understand deep learning models.
