In hidden states a dimension was blue when the agent sees the red armor before the green armor, and then remained orange until when saw the green armor ④. Another dimension was active as the agent first saw the HP, and remained active until it gathered it. Two hidden state elements that change as the agent gathered the health pack and then kept their values until the end of the episode ⑥. Using saliency maps ⑦, we can observe that the agent ignore the soul-sphere until it gathered the 3 firsts items ⑧. Finally, some clusters in the t-SNE projection seem to corresponds to the agent’s objectives e. g., gathering the green armor ⑨."

## Abstract   

We present DRLViz, a visual analytics interface to interpret the internal memory of an agent (e.g. a robot) trained using deep reinforcement learning. This memory is composed of large temporal vectors updated when the agent moves in an environment and is not trivial to understand. It is often referred to as a black box as only inputs (images) and outputs (actions) are intelligible for humans. Using DRLViz, experts are assisted to interpret using memory reduction interactions, to investigate parts of the memory role when errors have been made, and ultimately to improve the agent training process. We report on several examples of use of DRLViz, in the context of video games simulators (ViZDoom) for a navigation scenario with item gathering tasks. We also report on experts evaluation using DRLViz, and applicability of DRLViz to other scenarios and navigation problems beyond simulation games, as well as its contribution to black box models interpret-ability and explain-ability in the field of visual analytics.
